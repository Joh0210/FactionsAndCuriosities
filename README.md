A Minecraft mod that expands the world of magic to include additional factions!
<br>This mod is an extension for the magic mod [Mana and Artifice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mana-and-artifice). Thanks to Fhyx for creating some of the textures. The full credits can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Joh0210/FactionsAndCuriosities/blob/master/CREDITS.md).

The Codex has all the necessary information about the added elements. (But the content is only displayed when playing in American English (en_us))
<br>The mod can be added to modpacks. No need to ask.
